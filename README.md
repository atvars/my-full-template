# My First Web Page

    Welcome, this was my first website. I made it with HTML5 and CSS3 in Gitpod by using Code Institute made template, witch made life much easier.
All links will bring you to Wikipedia.com so you can find out about web developing tools. In future could add for each tool little space where my web visitors could try out some small easy codes and to see, maby they whould be interested them self to learn web developing.
